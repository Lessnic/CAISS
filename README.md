# Computer and algorithm interaction simulation software (CAISS).
Simulation software contains inside its core implemented with respect to mathematical model
representations of architecture and algorithm. Intended for simulation their interactions and
listing results for optimization purposes. It, in addition, includes a few benchmarks to comparison
with a real performance with simulation results for improving and testing purposes.

### Running in IDEA
